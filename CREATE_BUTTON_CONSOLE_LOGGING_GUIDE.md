## 🎯 What Each Log Entry Tells You

- **🚀** = System startup/initialization
- **🖱️** = User interaction/click events
- **🎯** = Function entry points
- **📋** = Status checks and validations
- **🔍** = Looking for DOM elements

## 🔧 If Issues Are Found

The console logs will show you exactly where any problems occur:

- **DOM Element Missing**: You'll see "❌ Missing" for any required elements
- **Event Binding Failure**: Look for warnings about event listeners
- **API Errors**: Full error responses from the server
- **JavaScript Errors**: Complete error stack traces
- **Timing Issues**: Timestamps show exact execution order

## 📝 Usage Instructions

3. **Read the Logs**: Follow the emoji-coded log entries to see the flow
